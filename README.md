# Cuphead PSP Port.
A little try to port a reduced version of Cuphead to this portable retro console (wrote on Game Maker 8).

# Summary.
This adaptation (port) was made just for fun and for a research work on an old Videogame Programming Enviroment, (**THIS IS COMPLETELY FREE AND IS NOT AN OFFICIAL WORK FROM THE RIGHTS OWNERS, PLEASE SUPPORT DE ORIGINAL AUTHORS PURCHASING A COPY OF THE ORIGINAL GAME**).

# Features.
The main theme of this project is trying to get a playable version of Cuphead for this retro console called PSP, as you know, that console is now a retro console made on 2010, and some people (like me) still giving support creating new projects just for nostalgia and like a "What if 'X' game were made for a PSP...?"
