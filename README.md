# Cuphead PSP Port.
A little try to port a reduced/lite version of Cuphead to this portable retro console (wrote on Game Maker 8).

# Summary.
This adaptation (port) was made just for fun and for a research work on an old Videogame Programming Enviroment, (**THIS IS COMPLETELY FREE AND IS NOT AN OFFICIAL WORK FROM THE RIGHTS OWNERS, PLEASE SUPPORT DE ORIGINAL AUTHORS PURCHASING A COPY OF THE ORIGINAL GAME - STUDIO MDHR**).

# Features.
The main theme of this project is trying to get a playable version of Cuphead for this retro console called PSP, as you know, that console is now a retro console made on 2010, and some people (like me) still giving support creating new projects just for nostalgia and like a "What if 'X' game were made for a PSP...?"

# Code details.
The latest version available at is an Alpha 0.0.6 (of course with a pair of bugs that are not really annoying for the gameplay experience) that you could get and test it on my GameJolt forum: https://gamejolt.com/@luigi2498/games
If you know a little about Game Maker 8 (maybe an obsolet version), this works by a .gmk file (a file that contains all the objects, rooms, sprites, textures, images, sounds, and other stuff), so thats why I can't put all the files that make up this project, like other repos, for example, wrote on a Programming Language like Python, C, C++ or Java, and so on.
By the way, I could upload the .gmk file for anyone who wants to try to fix some bugs or try to continue the game (if you fix something, please let me know on a message, and we could test it or even add you as a collaborator).

# Requirements.
-A PSP Console (doesn't matter the model, the game works on 1000-3000 models, I don't know certainly it it works on a PSP GO or PSP Street, you could even test it on PPSSPP Emulator).
-Game Maker 8 (the IDE).
-Chovy GM (kind of a compiler that converts the .exe file on a playable .iso): https://github.com/KuromeSan/chovy-gm/releases/

# Demostration and more information.
In this section you could see some images about the project, like the gameplay, some old tests and all that kind of stuff.
Please remember, if you want to see the gameplay or just more information about the project, you could go to my GameJolt profile and see more, or even on my Youtube Channel.
**And then, don't forgive to gave credits if you use this project, best regards and am so glad if you come to the end of this readme (its my first public repo on GitHub c:)**
