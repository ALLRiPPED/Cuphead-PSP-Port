# Cuphead PSP.
An attempt to port a reduced/lite version of Cuphead to this portable retro console (wrote on GML using Game Maker 8).

# Summary.
This adaptation (port) was made just for fun and for a research work on an old Videogame Programming Environment, (**THIS IS COMPLETELY FREE AND IS NOT AN OFFICIAL WORK FROM THE RIGHTS OWNERS, PLEASE SUPPORT THE ORIGINAL AUTHORS PURCHASING A COPY OF THE ORIGINAL GAME - STUDIO MDHR**).<br>

# Features.
The main theme of this project is trying to get a playable version of Cuphead for this retro console called PSP, as you know, that console is now a retro console made on 2010, and some people (like me) are still giving support creating new projects just for nostalgia and the idea of "What if 'X' game were made for a PSP...?"

# Code details.
The latest version available is an Alpha 0.8.2 (with a lot of fixes in comparison with the past alpha version 0.6) that you could get and test it on my GameJolt forum: https://gamejolt.com/@luigi2498/games<br>
If you know a little bit about Game Maker 8 (maybe an obsolete version), this works by a .gmk file (a file that contains all the objects, rooms, sprites, textures, images, sounds, and other stuff), so that's why I can't put all the files that make up this project, like other repos, for example, wrote on a Programming Language like Python, C, C++ or Java, and so on.<br>
By the way, I could upload the .gmk file for anyone who wants to try to fix some bugs or try to continue the game (if you fix or add something, please let me know in a message, and we could test it or even add you as a collaborator).<br>

# Requirements.
* A PSP Console (doesn't matter the model, the game works on 1000-3000 models, I don't know if it works on a PSP GO or PSP Street, you could even test it on a PPSSPP Emulator).<br>
* Game Maker 8 (the IDE).<br>
* Chovy GM v0.0.3 (kind of a compiler that converts the .exe file on a playable .iso): https://github.com/KuromeSan/chovy-gm/releases/<br>

# Demostration and more information.
In this section you could see some images about the project, like the gameplay, some old tests and all that kind of stuff.<br>
Please remember, if you want to see the gameplay or just more information about the project, you could go to my **[GameJolt](https://gamejolt.com/@luigi2498)** profile and take a deep look, or even on my **[Youtube Channel](https://youtu.be/bnPA69xp0BE)**.<br>
**And then, don't forget to give credits if you use this project, best regards and I'm so glad if you came to the end of this readme (its my first public repo on GitHub)**<br>
